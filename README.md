# Shortcut-Stacked Sentence Encoder

PyTorch re-implementation of [Shortcut-Stacked Sentence Encoders for Multi-Domain Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02312).

NOTE: Only codes to use SNLI as training data are implemented.

This is an unofficial implementation.
There is [the implementation by the authors](https://github.com/easonnie/multiNLI_encoder), which cannot be run currently due to missing files.

Tested on Python 3.6, PyTorch 0.2.0.
